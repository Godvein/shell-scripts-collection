# Shell Scripts Collection

A curated set of Bash scripts designed to simplify everyday tasks, automate workflows, and boost productivity on the command line.  
This repository acts as a growing toolbox of reusable and modular scripts â€” useful for system management, quick utilities, and learning Bash scripting practices.

## Features
- Organized scripts by category (e.g., password management, automation).  
- Lightweight and dependency-minimal (most scripts rely only on standard Linux utilities).  
- Easy to customize and extend for personal needs.
